              As a web developer, I have extensive experience in HTML, CSS,
              JavaScript and the React framework. My expertise in these
              technologies has allowed me to create dynamic and interactive
              websites that provide a seamless user experience. I particularly
              enjoy using React as it provides a flexible and efficient way to
              build user interfaces.
